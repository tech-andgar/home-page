This is the repo for build [my personal website `tech-andgar.me`](https://tech-andgar.me).

It content generated via utilizing [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [`hugo-coder`](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) theme, and GitHub actions to deploy static content to Github Pages when I push to it.

There's nothing super special here, other than a few changes here and there, but it's worth showing off the CI/CD pipeline.

Theme
I'm using [`Hugo-Coder`](https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder) but not as a submodule.

Typo style corrections welcome via PRs.
